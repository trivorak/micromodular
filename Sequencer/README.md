# Sequencer


### Plans
The original plan was to think of some interesting way to have limited user controls but after coming across my arduino mega I have enough analog in pins to attempt a simple 8 step sequencer. Would like to see an LED light above the step to indicate what step is active. Running test with arduino (09/04/2022)
